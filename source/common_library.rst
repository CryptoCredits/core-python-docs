====

Install

Common library is available through PyPI as ``credits.common``. To install run::

    pip install credits.common


Purpose
^^^^

Having installed that you will be able to import required parts of the framework,
build transactions locally, run tests against your code and interact with the remote
blockchain nodes. The common library will not give you a full running node, it is
designed as a tool for interaction with one through :ref:`PaaS API <paas-api>`.
