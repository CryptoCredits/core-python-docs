Government Agencies Onboarding
==============================


In order to procure the Credits Platform on the G-Cloud Digital Marketplace, you must be onboarded as a UK Government
customer and sign a service agreement before we can activate your account and distribute your API keys for platform
access.

If your department wishes to begin using the Credits G-Cloud Platform, please send an email from your government email
address to info@credits.vision with your contact details and a preferred time slot for an initial chat, and a member of
the Credits team will be in touch with you shortly.

After the onboarding process is complete, we will provide you with Platform access and a set of API keys that can be
used to deploy and control your Credits Blockchain networks.
