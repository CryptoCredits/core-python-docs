Getting started
====

To start building a blockchain, sign up with one of our cloud platforms. The
public PaaS is designed for the general public, while G-Cloud infrastructure is
designed for government agencies. This documentation transparently applies to
both platforms, the only difference being the onboarding processes and base API
domains.


Public platform onboarding
^^^^

You can access Credits public cloud blockchain beta platform at `public.credits.works
<https://public.credits.works>`_.

G-Cloud platform onboarding
^^^^

In order to sign-up for our G-Cloud offering, you will need to go through our
onboarding process, including verifying your organization as a qualified UK
government agency. You can find more details about this process :ref:`here
<gcloud-reference-label>`.


How to interact with the system
^^^^

Once you have been ouboarded and received your API keys you will need to create
your first blockchain network and start developing with it. You will bedeveloping
in Python using publicly accessible ``credits.common`` library.

The G-Cloud PaaS API is available at `gcloud.credits.works <https://gcloud.credits.works>`_.
The public PaaS API will become available again after the relaunch.
