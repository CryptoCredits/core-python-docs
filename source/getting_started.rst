.. _getting-started:

Getting started
===============

To start building a blockchain, sign up with one of our cloud platforms. The
public PaaS is designed for the general public, while G-Cloud infrastructure is
designed for government agencies. This documentation transparently applies to
both platforms, the only difference being the onboarding processes and base API
domains.


Public platform onboarding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can access Credits public cloud blockchain beta platform at
`public.credits.works <https://public.credits.works/api/v1/status>`_.
You can signup directly via the platform API itself following
:ref:`PaaS API documentation <paas-api>`.

G-Cloud platform onboarding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to sign-up for our G-Cloud offering, you will need to go through our
:ref:`onboarding process <gcloud-onboarding-process>`, including verifying your
organisation as a qualified UK government agency.


How to interact with the system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have registered with public API (or received API keys from us for GCloud)
you will need to create your first blockchain network and start developing with it.
You will be developing in Python using publicly accessible ``credits.common`` library.

The public PaaS API is available at `public.credits.works <https://public.credits.works/api/v1/status>`_.

The G-Cloud PaaS API is available at `gcloud.credits.works <https://gcloud.credits.works/api/v1/status>`_.
