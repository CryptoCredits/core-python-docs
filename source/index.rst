Welcome to Credits' cloud blockchain platform documentation!
====

Here you will find all the information necessary to begin building and deploying your own blockchain networks on any of
our platform offerings.

Getting started
~~~~

First thing to do to start building a blockchain will be to sign up with one of our cloud platforms. The public PaaS is
designed for general public, while G-Cloud infrastructure is designed for government agencies. This documentation
transparently applies to both platforms, with difference only in onboarding processes and base API domains.


Public platform onboarding
^^^^

You can access Credits public cloud blockchain beta platform at `credits.works <https://credits.works>`_. Since this
is a public platform you're welcome to register and use it without limitations. It is available free of charge for the
time of beta testing and we will be issuing separate warnings before starting to charge for it.

G-Cloud platform onboarding
^^^^

In order to sign-up for our G-Cloud offering, you will need to go through our onboarding process, including verifying
your organization as a qualified UK government agency. You can find more details about this process
:ref:`here <gcloud-reference-label>`.


How to interact with the system
~~~~

Once you have been ouboarded and received your API keys you will need to create your first blockchain network and
start developing with it.

The API for public PaaS is available at `public-api.credits.works <https://public-api.credits.works>`_, the G-Cloud API
is available at `gcloud.credits.works <https://gcloud.credits.works>`_.
