Welcome to Credits's documentation!
===================================

Here you will find all the information necessary to begin building and deploying your own blockchain networks on any of
our platform offerings.

Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

G-Cloud Platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to sign-up for our G-Cloud offering, you will need to go through our onboarding process, including verifying
your organization as a qualified UK government agency. You can find more details about this process
`here <%7B%%20post_url%202016-07-31-g-cloud-signup-process%20%%7D>`__.

Once your organization has been onboarded and you have received your API keys, you can follow the `Quickstart Guide
<%7B%%20post_url%202016-07-31-quick-start%20%%7D>`__ to build and launch your first Credits blockchain network.

Public Platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please check back throughout August for more information on our upcoming public cloud update. At the time of that
release, you will be able to access the full functionality of the Credits Framework through our cloud-hosted platform.

Developers
~~~~~~~~~~

You can learn more about how our system works and how to build blockchain networks using our framework and platform
using the tutorials to the left of the page.

A good starting point to get a general explanation of the system is our `Architecture Overview
<%7B%%20post_url%202016-07-31-architecture-overview%20%%7D>`__.  Following that, learn how to create basic functionality
in a Credits Module by following our tutorial on building :ref:`transform`

Once you have a basic understanding of these introductory topics, complete a full end-to-end deployment to our platform
by following our tutorial on `Cloud Deployment <architecture_overview.html>`__.
